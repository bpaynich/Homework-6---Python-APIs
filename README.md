#Analysis
* As you move up in latitude the temperature appears to gradually trend colder. This would make sense as you move towards the north pole.
* Humidity gradiants are pretty consistance across the latitudes. Most of the cities are showing a humidity rating above 50%.
* Cloudiness has two large clusters across the latitudes. These clusters indicate clear skies on versus mostly cloudy. It would be interesting to understand the method for determining percentage of cloudiness and how this is reported. It seems like this measurement could be very subjectivly reported.
* There doesn't seem to be a lot of connection between wind speed vs. latitude. There are a few locations with some gusting winds but most locations are pretty calm below 3 mph.
